## Problem 2

**Importing the dataset**
```{r}
birthweight_data = read_csv(file = "./data/birthweight.csv")
```

**Cleaning the dataset** 

```{r}
birthweight_data %>%
  sapply(function(x) sum(is.na(x))) 

birthweight_df = 
  birthweight_data %>%
  mutate(
    babysex = as.factor(babysex) 
  )



```


**Proposed regression model for the outcome birthweight.** 

Based on hypothesis found in literature, I have selected the following variables as predictors: 
Mother's weight gain during pregnancy (pounds) (wtgain)
Gestational age in weeks (gaweeks)
Smoking status - Average number of cigarettes smoked per day during pregnancy (smoken)
Babyâ€™s sex (babysex)

This model was decided based on literature evidence that suggested an association between these predictors and the baby's birthweight. 

**Building the proposed model:** 

```{r}
lin_model = lm(bwt ~ wtgain + gaweeks + smoken + babysex, data = birthweight_df)

lin_model %>%
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  select(term, estimate, p.value) %>% 
  mutate(term = str_replace(term, "babysex2", "baby's sex: female")) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)
```

```{r}
birthweight_df %>% 
  modelr::add_residuals(lin_model) %>% 
  modelr::add_predictions(lin_model) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = pred, y = resid)) + geom_point()
```

**Buiding the other two models:**

Model 2: 

```{r}
lin_model2 = lm(bwt ~ blength + gaweeks, data = birthweight_df)

lin_model2 %>%
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  select(term, estimate, p.value) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)
```

Model 3: 

```{r}
lin_model3 = lm(bwt ~ bhead + blength + babysex, data = birthweight_df)

lin_model3 %>%
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  select(term, estimate, p.value) %>% 
  mutate(term = str_replace(term, "babysex2", "baby's sex: female")) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)
```
